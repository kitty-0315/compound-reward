# Compound Reward

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/CompoundingReward.ts --network fantom
```

## Running Frontend
```shell
cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```
